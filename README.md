# Vim-Advent-Calendar
A calendar all about (probably) the best editor there has ever existed:)
As you can tell, I'm just a little bit biased, but this does not mean, that you cannot form you own opinions.
So try all the things in the calendar to get a good idea of the power and capabilities of (Neo)Vim.
You're going to learn the basics, random tricks, configuration and advanced usage.
Maybe it is a bit much for 24 days, but if you continue to use (Neo)Vim, you'll be amazed how great it is:)

## Usage
1. `unzip -P <PASSWORD> path/to/Door_<X>`
2. Profit:)
